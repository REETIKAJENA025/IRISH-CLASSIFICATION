# IRISH-CLASSIFICATION
Overview
This project aims to classify Irish plant species using popular classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 observations of iris plants, with each observation having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each plant into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

Dataset
Name: Iris Dataset
Features:
Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
Target: Species of Iris plant (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
Size: 150 observations, 4 features, and 3 classes.
Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, but here itâ€™s extended for multi-class classification.
K Neighbors Classifier: A classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the labels of their nearest neighbors.
Decision Tree: A tree-structured classifier where internal nodes represent features, branches represent decision rules, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
